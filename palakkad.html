                <p>Celebrated as the Granary of Kerala, Palakkad is a vast stretch of fertile plains interspersed with hills, rivers, mountain streams and forests. The gateway to Kerala from the north, a 40 kilometre break in the mountains known as the Palakkad Gap gives access to this land situated at the foot of the Western Ghats. The pass acts as a corridor between Kerala and the neighbouring Tamil Nadu and played a key role in the trade relations between the east and west coasts of peninsular India.Deriving its name from the Malayalam words Pala (Alsteriascholaris) and Kadu (forest). </p>
