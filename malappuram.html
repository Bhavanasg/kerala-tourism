A hill station of Kerala, the place is perched on a height of about 522 m above sea level, and is the highest point in the Amminikkadan hills.Once the spot where the Britishers once hoisted their flag, the spot was opened for tourism only a few decades ago, with a large area of the place marked already for future development projects. </p>

The river has been an integral part of life in the southern regions of Malabar. The name Nila has been given to the river to show the importance of it being more than just a river, as there are several mentions of the river in the ancient Hindu scriptures. </p>

                        <p class="card-text">A natural cascading waterfall, the Adyanpara is counted amongst the best of Malappuram tourist places. Located in in the Kurmbalangodu village of Nilambur district near Malappuram, the waterfalls are a seasonal delight.In summers, the water runs dry and with a lesser flow, but are nonetheless similarly beautiful to look at. The waters of the falls descend down in a cascade over the rocks of the hill, with a rich variety of flora around it to make it look even more mesmerizing.</p>
